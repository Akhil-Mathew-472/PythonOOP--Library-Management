# PythonOOP--Library-Management
A simple example for Object Oriented Programming in Python

Note: This program is a simple program for showcasing the Object Oriented Programming and its ease of use. There is no graphical interface in this.
**N.B:** This code uses dictionary to store user and book details. Upon exiting the program, all data will be lost. Like I said, this program is only to showcase OOP nature of Python.

## **Sub Programs and their functions**
